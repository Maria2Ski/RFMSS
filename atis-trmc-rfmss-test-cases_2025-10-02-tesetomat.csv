Steps: 10. Repeat steps 4-9 for a total of 10 iterations for each complexity level
to get average response times.
Expected Result: 10. 30 response time measurements (10 for each complexity level) are recorded.
Steps: 11. Perform a search that retrieves the maximum allowed number of results.


Expected Result: 11. The system successfully retrieves and displays the maximum allowed
number of results.


Steps: 12. Record the time taken for the maximum result search operation and
